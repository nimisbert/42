Answers to the questions of my universe and anything...

## HW

The HW folder contains electronic Hardware schematics and routings, using Kicad. Some simulations with LTspice as well.

| [power_supply](./HW/power_supply/) | is a bad power supply from 230V AC to 10-15V DC, needs a rework |
| [simulations](./HW/simulations/)   | electrical simulations with LTspice                             |

## SW 

The SW folder contains software of different languages tackling topics of scientific fields.
