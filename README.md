Answers to the questions of my universe and anything...

## HW

The HW folder contains electronic Hardware schematics and routings, using Kicad.

| folder       | description                                                                         |

| power_supply | is a mediocre power supply converting 230V AC to 10-15V DC, it badly needs a rework |

## SW 

The SW folder contains codes in different languages.
For now they are a bit jumbled together... but there are two main topics for now.

| folder       | description                                                                         |

| hs           | folder where I learn functional programming with Haskell                            |
| the rest     | folders where I learn algorithms and data structures in C                           |

When I will have learnt enough, I will create subfolders containing projects.
